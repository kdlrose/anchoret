hello :)

I want to love the Internet like I did on Neopets, so in lieu of social media I welcome you to a static anchoret cell served with Jekyll. its contents are ravings, code bits, and something that passes for a portfolio.

as of fall 2023 I am finishing an MA in religion and theology and not taking any dramaturgy or production gigs, but my big 2022 projects are out on Audible Theater now: *Dirty Laundry* by Mathilde Dratwa and *Vanessa in Bed* by Diana Grisanti.

these days I <3 `lua` and `bash`, though my first love remains front-end development. I live and die by `dart-sass`.
